    "text": "This research group is part of the Solid Mechanics Laboratory (LMS) under the auspices of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) and the Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IPP).\nWe focuses on the development of real-time digital twins for metal additive manufacturing. We adopt a multidisciplinary approach that combines thermal analysis, theoretical mechanics, computational materials science, neural networks, and experimental validation. Our primary goal is to develop computationally efficient simulation tools for additive manufacturing processes—particularly directed energy deposition. Such part-scale, rapid models enable the optimization of residual stress states and the design of targeted microstructures.\nAdditionally, the research group is oriented toward real-world applications such as part repair, embedding sensors within additively manufactured components, and advancing technologies that support low-carbon energy production."

However, intensified use of existing infrastructure and stringent design demands in new technologies make continuous material health monitoring essential. Yet, most critical parts are made of high-strength metals with high melting points, preventing direct sensor integration via welding or casting. FIBER3D proposes a groundbreaking fabrication technology that enables the production of sensors that can be directly welded onto existing surfaces or embedded within newly manufactured metal components. This is achieved by combining optical fiber sensors—capable of measuring temperature and strain along their length—with advanced spraying and 3D-printing techniques. The consortium, formed by world-leading experts in photonics, chemistry, materials science, metallurgy, thermo-mechanics, applied mathematics, and mechanical design, offers guarantees of success. FIBER3D’s technology can be applied across the entire existing Europe’s railway network, hydrogen transport systems, and nuclear infrastructure, as well as in 3D-printed parts for low-carbon technologies. This unique and transformative material health monitoring approach will significantly improve the sustainability, safety, and competitiveness of key industries by enabling real-time diagnostics and predictive maintenance, preventing catastrophic failures. FIBER3D will revolutionize material health monitoring in both existing and future industrial systems."

    "text": "Additive manufacturing (AM) processes of the L-DED (Laser Directed Energy Deposition) type, whether using powder or wire, are particularly well suited for repairing damaged or worn metallic parts. They are already used for the repair of turbine blades [1] in the civil sector, and several national and European projects are currently focusing on this topic. However, it is still very difficult to predict, optimize, and control the distortions and residual stresses introduced by these deposits in the often complex repaired parts. This constitutes a major obstacle to the qualification of repaired components. The reasons are mainly three scientific challenges: * (1) macroscale numerical models that are fast enough are often insufficiently predictive; * (2) microscale models are inapplicable to full 3D part simulations due to their computational cost—yet this is essential in a repair context; * (3) in-situ data and measurements to validate numerical approaches and control the process in real time across a wide range of parameters (e.g., laser power, scan speed and strategy, use of the laser or argon flow to perform heat treatments during nozzle repositioning between layers, etc.) remain scarce. The PhD fits into the project “Limiting residual distortions during repairs by additive manufacturing” (LIDRES), funded by the Centre Interdisciplinaire d’Études pour la Défense et la Sécurité (CIEDS), which aims to remove the scientific obstacles identified above. The simplified, fast large-scale L-DED process models developed at LMS constitute a solid initial foundation but need to be extended and integrated into a numerical process-parameter optimization strategy and a neural network training workflow to develop a fast digital twin of the process. In addition, in-situ measurements on the BeAM machine (X-ENSTA, mechanics department) are being developed at LMS and will continue during the LIDRES project through a post-doctoral position. These measurements will not only allow model validation under varied and complex conditions but also enable the establishment of real-time process-control loops, thus helping to remove the third obstacle.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch conducted at LMS over the past five years provides a foundation for developing a global, extremely fast model of the complete process. Several computational codes have been developed and must be extended as part of the PhD: * ScanFast [2–4] allows rapid calculation of thermal kinetics during DED processes under the assumption of a thin-wall structure (i.e., a single bead through the thickness). The theoretical and numerical extensions will expand its validity to more complex multi-track situations (multiple beads through the thickness). * QuadWire [5–7] is a one-dimensional theoretical mechanics model specifically designed for additive manufacturing problems where a highly slender bead is deposited to form a bulk part. We have shown that this model drastically reduces the total number of degrees of freedom needed to simulate structures during printing. Future developments must incorporate elastoplastic behaviors adapted to the L-DED process. These codes are currently developed separately in Python. They will be unified into a single, easy-to-use tool, forming a complete digital twin of the process. This twin will be experimentally validated through tests conducted in the associated post-doctoral project. Furthermore, optimization strategies for process parameters will be developed to minimize residual stresses and distortions using the digital twin. Interfaces Between the Part and the Repair.\nOne specific feature of repair, compared with standard additive manufacturing, is that the printing support is no longer a simple plate substrate with easily defined boundary conditions but a larger, more complex part relative to the repair dimensions, which must be considered. Thus, a modular approach must be developed, where the part to be repaired is not simulated in detail but reduced in scale as an equivalent substrate with the correct exchange conditions with the printed region.\n\n\n\nThe intrinsic variability of processes and of the parts to be repaired leads to a discrepancy between simulations and the actual fabrication/repair. It is therefore essential to control the process in real time to avoid deviating from the desired characteristics. Since the digital twin is sufficiently fast, it can be used to generate a large database and thus train a neural network. This network must be trained specifically to adjust process parameters based on the deviation between a target and a measurement. During the PhD, this task will initially be performed entirely numerically using synthetic measurements. Keywords: Additive manufacturing; repair; fast simulation; residual stresses and distortions; digital twin\n\n\n\n\nStrong knowledge in thermo-mechanics and numerical simulation is required.

    "text": "Additive manufacturing (AM) processes of the L-DED type (Laser Directed Energy Deposition), whether using powder or wire, are particularly suitable for repairing damaged or worn metallic parts. They are already used for turbine blade repair in the civil sector, and several national and European projects are currently focused on this topic. However, it remains very difficult to predict, optimize, and control the distortions and residual stresses introduced by these deposits in repaired parts, which are often complex in geometry. This represents a major obstacle to the qualification of repaired components. Three main scientific challenges explain this difficulty: (1) Macroscopic numerical models that are fast enough are often not predictive enough, (2) Microscopic models cannot be applied to full 3D part simulations because of their computational cost, even though this is essential in the repair context, (3) In-situ data and measurements needed to validate numerical approaches and control the process in real time across a wide range of parameters (e.g., laser power, scanning speed and strategy, use of the laser or argon flow for heat treatments during nozzle repositioning phases between layer depositions, etc.) are scarce. The postdoctoral project is part of the LIDRES project (“Limiting Residual Distortions During Repairs by Additive Manufacturing”), funded by the Centre Interdisciplinaire d’Études pour la Défense et la Sécurité (CIEDS). This project aims to overcome the scientific barriers identified above. In-situ measurements using a 5-axis BeAM L-DED machine are currently being developed at the Laboratoire de Mécanique des Solides (LMS) and will be continued during the postdoctoral project. These will allow not only the validation of existing models under varied and complex conditions but also the establishment of real-time process control loops, thus addressing the third scientific challenge.\n\n\n\nThe first step will involve defining “academic” test specimens representative of the targeted structures (materials, types of repair zones, loading conditions). The goal is to design several geometries that will later serve for mechanical characterization tests. It will be essential to use 5-axis toolpath generation codes to prevent collisions between the deposition nozzle and elements of the part to be repaired. The tested and analyzed zones will typically be on the order of a few mm² to cm²—small compared to real parts. In a second phase, instrumented experiments (using a pyrometer, thermal camera, and visible camera) will be carried out on the BeAM powder-based DED machine at LMS. These experiments will enable multiscale measurements during the process (primarily local and/or global temperatures, displacements, and deformations) to recalibrate the models developed at LMS and within the LIDRES PhD project. After fabrication, the microstructures (repairs, interfaces) will be characterized and compared to the initial substrate. The residual stresses and distortions induced by the process will be estimated at various scales, in collaboration with BAM in Berlin [6]. As the project progresses, methods to reduce residual stresses during the process will be explored. Beyond global substrate heating—already investigated in the literature—local induction heating could be considered. Such localized thermal treatment could help control and minimize residual stresses. At the end of the work, a repair will be performed on a so-called “technological” specimen, whose geometry will be based on a real part of interest. This specimen will serve as a demonstrator, confirming that the results obtained on “academic” specimens and through simulations can be scaled up to larger and more complex geometries.\n\n\n\nAdditive manufacturing; repair; in-operando / in-situ measurements\n\n\n\nEuropean, English, or Swiss nationality (for defense-related reasons).

The optimization will rely on fast numerical models of the process, while the control strategy will rely on a neural network interpreting in-situ displacements measured by image correlation. The experiments will be conducted first on simple geometries with full-field measurements during the process, and then on geometries that are more representative of real applications."
